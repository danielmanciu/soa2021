# UBB SOA Exam Project

This Voting application allows the user to login and answer a question, by voting one of
the given options. The application uses the ​ Microservices Architecture, Database
per Service ​ and ​ Access Token patterns. It has two back-end microservices: one for
authorization features and one for managing votes. The microservices are
implemented using the Spring framework (Spring JPA, Spring Security, Spring Boot),
PostgreSQL as the database management system and Liquibase for database migration
and schema changes.
